<p>Dear <%= @resource.parent_name %>,</p>

<p>Please find attached 3 forms, one which outlines the enrolled sessions your student will be enrolled for and the second is an agreement that outlines the roles and responsibilities that you will play in your studentâ€™s academic success. The third is a payment detail form and all payment is to be made to the lower office. Your sessions will be $20 a session.</p>

<p>It is important that I stress that the time the tutors have with your student is minimal compared to the time in which they spend at home and as such the agreement encourages you the parent/guardian to continue the work we do with your student.</p>

<p>Please bring the agreement signed to the first session.<br /> 
	 Please let me know if you have any further questions. </p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
